                    Aplication Programming Interface is a collection of communication protocols.
                    An API, or Application Programming Interface, is like a translator that helps different software programs talk to each other. 
                    It provides a set of rules and tools that developers can use to make their applications work together smoothly. 
                    By using APIs, developers can easily add features to their software without having to write all the code from scratch.
                    Think of an API as a middleman. When you make a request, the API takes it, passes it to the service provider, and then brings the response back to you. 
                    This makes it easier for programs to share information and perform tasks together.

                    APIs are used everywhere in software development, whether it's for operating systems, databases, hardware, or web applications.
                    While a Graphical User Interface (GUI) helps users interact with software visually, an API helps developers access and use web tools and services efficiently, making the whole process of building and improving software much simpler.

                <p>An Application programming interface is a software interface that helps in connecting between the computer or between computer programs. </p>

                <h2><b>API working procedure:</b></h2>
                <p><li>The client initiates the request via APIs URL.</li>
                    <li>API make a call to the server after receiving the request from client.</li>
                    <li>Then server sends the response back to the API with the information.</li>
                    <li>Finally, the API transfers the data to the client.</li>
                </p>

                <h2>API Architecture</h2>
                <p>The architecture of an API refers to the framework and rules that dictate how APIs are designed and implemented. 
                    These architectures define how data is exchanged between different software components and outline the protocols, 
                    structures, and constraints that govern the API's operation.
                    API architecture, in its simplest form, is the blueprint or design that governs how an API is structured, organized, and implemented. 
                    It's like the architectural plans for a building - it outlines the different components, their interactions, 
                    and how they fit together to create a cohesive and functional whole.

                <p>
                    Web API architecture refers to the framework and design principles used to create and implement APIs that are accessible over the internet.
                    This architecture defines how web APIs are structured, how they handle requests and responses, and how they interact with other web services and applications.
                    A Web API also called Web Services is an extensively used API over the web and can be easily accessed using the HTTP protocols.
                    A Web application programming interface is an open-source interface and can be used by a large number of clients through their phones, tablets, or PCs. 
                    Here are the key components and types of web API architecture:

                                <b>REST:</b>
                                Standard for Representational State Transfer is a Stateless, client-server architecture.
                                Uses standard HTTP methods and operates on resources identified by URLs. 
                                REST architecture follows principles like scalability, uniform interface, and resource-based interactions.
                                REST stands for Representational State Transfer, and follows the constraints of REST architecture allowing interaction with RESTful web services. 
                                It defines a set of functions (GET, PUT, POST, DELETE) that clients use to access server data.

                                The remote procedural call (RPC) protocol is a simple means to send multiple parameters and receive results.
                                RPC APIs invoke executable actions or processes, while REST APIs mainly exchange data or resources such as documents. 
                                RPC can employ two different languages, JSON and XML, for coding; these APIs are dubbed JSON-RPC and XML-RPC, respectively.

                                Standard for Simple Object Access Protocol is Protocol-based architecture using XML for message format.
                                Highly extensible with built-in error handling and security features.
                                Operates over various protocols like HTTP, SMTP, and more.
                                The simple object access protocol (SOAP) is a messaging standard defined by the World Wide Web Consortium and broadly used to create web APIs, usually with XML.
                                SOAP supports a wide range of communication protocols found across the internet, such as HTTP, SMTP and TCP/IP.
                                SOAP is also extensible and style-independent, which enables developers to write SOAP APIs in varied ways and easily add features and functionality.
                                The SOAP approach defines how the SOAP message is processed, the features and modules included, the communication protocol(s) supported and the construction of SOAP messages.

                                An alternative to REST, allowing clients to request exactly the data they need.
                                Uses a single endpoint and a query language to fetch and manipulate data.
                                Can reduce the number of requests needed and improve performance.
                                GraphQL is an open-source data query language for APIs and It is a server-side runtime for executing the query. 
                                The server's GraphQL runtime takes care of executing the query and ensuring that the right data is fetched and sent back.

                <p>
                    WebSocket is bidirectional, a full-duplex protocol that is used in the same scenario of client-server communication, unlike HTTP it starts from ws:// or wss://. 
                    It is a stateful protocol, which means the connection between client and server will keep alive until it is terminated by either party (client or server). 
                    After closing the connection by either of the client and server, the connection is terminated from both ends. 
                    WebSocket is a bidirectional communication protocol that can send the data from the client to the server or from the server to the client by reusing the established connection channel. 
                    The connection is kept alive until terminated by either the client or the server.

                <p>
                    A library-based API refers to an Application Programming Interface that is provided as part of a software library or package.
                    This type of API allows developers to use predefined functions, classes, and methods to interact with and manipulate the functionality provided by the library. 
                    Library-based APIs are typically included in programming languages or frameworks and are designed to simplify and standardize common tasks,
                    enabling developers to build applications more efficiently.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Library-based APIs are essential tools in software development, providing developers with powerful, reusable components that simplify the development process.
                    By leveraging these APIs, developers can build robust applications more efficiently and maintain a higher standard of code quality.
                </p>

                <h1 >4. Class based APIs</h1>
                <p>
                    A class-based API refers to an Application Programming Interface that is designed around classes and objects, following the principles of object-oriented programming (OOP).
                    In a class-based API, functionality is organized into classes, which encapsulate data and behavior, allowing developers to create objects and interact with them through methods and properties. 
                    This approach promotes modularity, reusability, and maintainability in software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Class-based APIs provide a robust framework for building applications using object-oriented principles.
                    They enable developers to create modular, reusable, and maintainable code by organizing functionality into classes and objects.
                    This approach not only improves code quality but also simplifies the development and maintenance of complex software systems.
