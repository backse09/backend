            <p>
                A database is an organized collection of data stored in a computer system and usually controlled by a database management system (DBMS).
                The data in common databases is modeled in tables, making querying and processing efficient. Structured query language (SQL) is commonly used for data querying and writing.

                The Database is an essential part of our life. We encounter several activities that involve our interaction with databases,
                for example in the bank, in the railway station, in school, in a grocery store, etc.
                These are the instances where we need to store a large amount of data in one place and fetch these data easily.

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Relational Databases:</strong> A relational database's contents are arranged as a collection of tables with rows and columns. Accessing structured data is made most flexible and efficient by relational database technology.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Object-Oriented Databases:</strong> Similar to object-oriented programming, data in an object-oriented database is represented as objects.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Distributed Databases:</strong> A distributed database is made up of two or more files that are spread across multiple locations. The database could be dispersed across many networks, housed in one physical place, or kept on several computers.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Data Warehouses:</strong> A data warehouse is a sort of database created especially for quick query and analysis. It is a central repository for data.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>NoSQL Databases:</strong> Unlike relational databases, which specify how all data input must be formatted, NoSQL, or nonrelational databases, permit the storing and manipulation of unstructured and semistructured data. The prevalence and complexity of online applications led to the rise in popularity of NoSQL databases.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Graph Databases:</strong> Data is stored in a graph database using entities and their relationships.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>OLTP Database:</strong> An OLTP database is a quick, analytical database made to handle lots of transactions from several users at once.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Open Source Databases:</strong> A database system that is open source can have either a SQL or NoSQL database as its source code.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Cloud Databases:</strong> A collection of organized or unorganized data that is housed on a private, public, or hybrid cloud computing platform is known as a cloud database. Cloud database models come in two flavors: traditional and database as a service (DBaaS). With DBaaS, a service provider handles maintenance and administrative duties.</li>
