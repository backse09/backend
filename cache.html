                <p>
                    A computer is an electronic device and that accepts data,
                    processes on that data, and gives the desired output.
                    It performs programmed computation with accuracy and speed.
                    Or in other words, the computer takes data as input and stores the data/instructions in the memory (use them when required). 
                    After processes the data, it converts into information. Finally, gives the output.
                </p>
                <p>Computer memory is just like the human brain. It is used to store data/information and instructions.
                    It is a data storage unit or a data storage device where data is to be processed and instructions required for processing are stored.
                    It can store both the input and output can be stored here.
                </p>
                <h2>Types of Memory</h2>
                <p>Generally computer memory is three types, they are-</p>

                    <h1>1. Primary memory</h1>
                    <p>
                        It is also known as the main memory of the computer system.
                        It is used to store data and programs or instructions during computer operations.
                        It uses semiconductor technology and hence is commonly called semiconductor memory.
                    </p>
                    <p><b>Primary memory is of two types:</b></p>
                    <li>
                        <b>RAM:</b> Random Access Memory (RAM) is a vmemory stores information based on the power suply. 
                        RAM is the hardware in computer device that provides temporary storage for the operating system (OS),
                        software programs and any other data in current use so they are quickly available to the device's processor.
                        RAM is often referred to as a computer's main memory or primary memory, as processor cache.

                    <li>
                        <b>ROM:</b> Read Only Memory is a non vilatile memory that stores information even when there is a power
                        supply failed or interrupted.
                        It is also the primary memory unit of a computer along with the random access memory (RAM).
                        It is called read only memory as we can only read the programs and data stored on it but cannot write on it.
                        It is restricted to reading words that are permanently stored within the unit

                    <p>
                        It is non volatile memory and used to store a large amount of data. 
                        The data stored in secondary memory is permanently, and it is slower than primary memory.
                        A computer CPU can not directly access secondary memory.
                        The data firstly allocated from secondary memory into primary memory,
                        and then the computer CPU access those data.

                        plastic plate and thse plates are coated with magnetic material.
                        This is used on both sides, bits are stored in magnetized surfaces in locations
                        called tracks that run in concentric rings.
                        Sectors are typically used to break tracks into pieces.

                        called RECORDS that run along many tracks.
                        Each track has one read/write head, which allows data to be recorded and read as a sequence of characters.
                        It can be stopped, started moving forward or backward, or rewound.

                    <h1>3. Cache memory</h1>
                    <p>
                        Cache memory is a high-speed memory, which is small in size but faster than the main memory (RAM).
                        The CPU can access it more quickly than the primary memory.
                        So, it is used to synchronize with high-speed CPU and to improve its performance.
                        Cache memory is a small, high-speed storage area in a computer.
                        The cache is a smaller and faster memory that stores copies of the data from frequently used main memory locations.
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        There are various independent caches in a CPU, which store instructions and data.
                        Cache memory can only be accessed by CPU. It can be a reserved part of the main memory or a storage device outside the CPU.
                        It holds the data and programs which are frequently used by the CPU. 
                    </p>
                    <p>    
                        So, it makes sure that the data is instantly available for CPU whenever the CPU needs this data. 
                        In other words, if the CPU finds the required data or instructions in the cache memory, 
                        it doesn't need to access the primary memory (RAM).
                        Thus, by acting as a buffer between RAM and CPU, it speeds up the system performance.
                        The most important use of cache memory is that it is used to reduce the average time to access data from the main memory.
