                A network protocol is a set of rules that govern data communication between different devices in the network.
                It determines what is being communicated, how it is being communicated, and when it is being communicated.
                It permits connected devices to communicate with each other, irrespective of internal and structural differences.
            </p>

            <p>
                An approved set of rules that control data transmission across various networked devices is known as a network protocol.
                These set of rules specify the data's transmission, reception,
                and processing steps and make sure that devices can comprehend and analyze the data they share.
                It makes it possible for connected devices to interact with one another despite internal and structural differences.
            </p>

                <p>
                    These protocols formally set out the rules and formats through which data is transferred.
                    The foundation of data transmission and information flow in computer networks is communication protocols.
                    To ensure seamless and dependable communication, they specify the policies and norms defining how data is formatted, sent, and received between devices.
                    These protocols formally lay out the guidelines and file types used for data transmission.
                    Syntax, semantics, error detection, synchronization, and authentication are all handled by these protocols.
                </p>
                <p>Below mentioned are some network communication protocol:</p>
                <li>
                    <b>TCP/IP:</b> Stand for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol.
                    TCP layouts a reliable stream delivery by using sequenced acknowledgment. 
                    It is a connection-oriented protocol i.e., 
                    it establishes a connection between applications before sending any data. 
                    It is used for communicating over a network.
                    IP (Internet Protocol) for addressing and routing packets. 
                    Data is divided into packets, transported via networks, and precisely reassembled at the destination, thanks to TCP/IP.
                    It is a protocol through which data is sent from one host to another over the internet. 
                    It is used for addressing and routing data packets so that they can reach their destination.

                </li>
                <p></p>
                <li><b>HTTP:</b>
                    Stand for Hypertext Transfer Protocol, The World Wide Web uses the HTTP protocol to communicate web pages 
                    and resources they are connected with.
                    Web browser as a client submit HTTP request to web server, the web server after processing query or handle this request return response.
                    This process is known as a request response protocol.
                </li>

                <li>
                    <b>HTTPS:</b> It is Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure, HTTPS is an HTTP extension that adds Security
                    using SSL/TLS encryption.
                    It makes sure that sensitive data, including login passwords, personal information, 
                    and financial transactions, 
                    is encrypted before it is transferred between a web browser and a web server.
                    It is the secured version of HTTP. this protocol ensures secure communication between two computers 
                    where one sends the request through the browser and the other fetches the data from the web server.

                    <b>FTP</b>: File Transfer Protocol is a method for quickly moving file between computers connected to a network.
                    The transfer of files to or from a host computer is facilitated by the client-server protocol FTP. Using FTP, 
                    users can download documents, software, web pages, and other resources from other services.
                    FTP is a Client/server protocol that is used for moving files to or from a host computer, it allows users to download files, 
                    programs, web pages, and other things that are available on other services.

                <li>
                    <b>SMTP:</b> Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, between email clients and servers, email message sent and relayed via the SMTP protocol.
                    When you send an email, your email client connects through SMTP to the server of your email provider,
                    which then routes the message to its intended recipient.

                <li>
                    <b>POP3:</b> Post Office Protocol version 3 are used by email client to retrieve messages from a mail server.
                    Internet Message Access Protocol (IMAP) maintains messages on the server while syncing messages across various devices,
                    which normally downloads message to a local device.
                    POP3 is a protocol that local mail clients use to connect to a remote email server and download emails. 
                    ISPs frequently use POP3 to store and retrieve emails for their customers. Once the email client has obtained these emails, 
                    they are finally downloaded and typically deleted from the server.

                <p>
                    For routers and other network devices to choose the best routes for data packets as they travel through a network, 
                    routing protocols are essential algorithms and rules. 
                    They are essential to guaranteeing effective data routing and delivery. The following are two well-known routing protocols:
                    Based on the number of network hops (the number of routers a packet must pass through), RIP determines the optimum path for data packets. 
                    It keeps track of these hop counts to destination networks in routing tables.

                    <li><b>Routing Information Protocol (RIP):</b> RIP is frequently used in tiny to medium-sized networks when configuration simplicity and convenience are top priorities.
                    </li>

                    <p></p>
                    <li><b>Open Shortes Path First (OSPF):</b> OSPF is frequently used in larger, more intricate networks, such as businesses and Internet service providers (ISPs).
                        OSPF creates and keeps an up-to-date map of the entire network, complete with linkages and router status. 
                        Based on this extensive topology data, it determines the shortest path to a destination.

                    <b>SSL:</b>
                    Secure Socket Layer is a network security protocol mainly used for protecting sensitive data and securing internet connections. 
                    SSL allows both server-to-server and client-to-server communication. 
                    All the data transferred through SSL is encrypted thus stopping any unauthorized person from accessing it.

                    Transport Layer Security is a security protocol designed for data security and privacy over the internet, its functionality is encryption,
                    checking the integrity of data i.e., whether it has been tampered with or not, and authentication. 
                    It is generally used for encrypted communication between servers and web apps, 
                    like a web browser loading a website, it can also be used for encryption of messages, emails, and VoIP.
